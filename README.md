:new: features in version 1.7b

> 2. menu white list, fix bug where menu opens up in vehicle, improve sync 

to update to newest version remove previous install and install new files. clear your cache of FiveEMS files and restart the resource, resource Folder **Must be Named FiveEMS to work** 

1. new chat commands  /delhaztent and /delbluetent use this to delete the tents!!
2. script will now place the closet ped or a.i on the stretcher, for those who want to RP with the ped or on FivePD servers
Ped placement is buggy this is to be expected if you play lspdfr. working on a fix for this.


# Install 

1. Drag and Drop <b><p color='red'>FiveEMS</p></B> folder fo your resources folder, rename or make sure the folder is named <p color='red'>FiveEMS</p>
<B>FOLDER MUST BE NAMED FiveEMS or it wont work!!!</B>

`
**Install for ESX Servers** remove UI folder and the entries in fxmanifest.lua that refer to the UI, also may need to adjust or add es_extended reference, now load the items.sql and the items can now be pulled from players item inventory and returned. because inventory is mangaged via this system ESX servers dont get an F7 menu only the stretcher menu and Vehicie UI Menu will work for them. Other install issues that may arrise is menu conflict with item inventory, you can comment out these sections in the config.lua`

2. edit the config.lua and add perms/keys
3. add ``` ensure FiveEMS``` to your server.cfg
Please remove any previous versions of this script
4. Press ```F7``` to open menu, edit controls in config.lua 
5. walk up to any compatible vehicle or stretcher to get a menu display option.
 enjoy!

and Hazmat Tent setup, be sure to setup on a flat ground or surface. 

```xml
  -- {hash = `name of vehicle`, item = 'es_extend item name', remove = how many item to remove on use},
  {hash = `Stretcher`,          type = 'veh',  item = 'stretcher',  remove = 1}, -- When using the stretcher  item, it will spawn a Stretcher vehicle and remove 1x item
  {hash = `stryker_M1`,         type = 'veh',  item = 'stretcher2', remove = 1},
  {hash = `stryker_M1_coroner`, type = 'veh',  item = 'stretcher3', remove = 1},
  {hash = `prop_ld_binbag_01`,  type = 'prop', item = 'stretcher4', remove = 1}, <--hazmat tent-->  -- When using the stretcher  item, it will spawn a prop_ld_binbag_01 prop and remove 1x item
  {hash = `mxpro`,			    type = 'veh',  item = 'stretcher5', remove = 1},
  {hash = `stretcher_basket`,	type = 'veh',  item = 'stretcher5', remove = 1},
  ```

to ems only.
